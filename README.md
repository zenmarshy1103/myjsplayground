SOURCES OF DATA
1. From the program itself (Data written directly in source code)
2. From the UI (Data input from teh user or data written in DOM)
3. From External Source (Date Fetched from Web API)

STORE COLLECTION OF DATA from their Sources
1. Simple List -> Array or Sets
2. Key and Value Pairs -> Object or Maps

API DATA TYPE:
Is in JSON format (Contains Objects , Array )

Other Data Types in JS:
<BUILD IN>
1. WeakMap
2. weakSet

<Not Build IN>
1. Stacks
2. Queues
3. Linked Lists
4. Trees
5. Hash Tabls

ARRAYs vs Sets
<Use Arrays>
1. When you need ordered list of values( may contain duplicates)
2. When you need to manipulate data

<Use Sets>
1. When you need to work with unique values
2. When high performance is really important
3. To remove duplicates from Arrays.

OBJECTs vs MAPs
<Use Objects>
1. More Traditional Key / Value store ("abused" objects)
2. Easier to write and access values with . and []
3. When you need to include functions / methods
4. When working with JSON data (Can be converted to Map)

<Use Maps>
1. Better Performance
2. Keys can be any data type
3. Easy to iterate
4. Easy to compute size
5. When you simply need to map key to values
6. When you need keys that are not strings
