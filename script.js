// Functions - First Class and Higher Order Functions (THEORY)
// - FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS:  (There are no FIRST CLASS FUNCTION in practice rather it is just a FEATURE of JavaScript)
//      -> JavaScript treats functions as FIRST CLASS CITIZENS
//      -> This means that functions are simple values
//      -> FUnction are just another TYPE of OBJECT
// - Function:
//      -> Stores function in variable or properties
//      -> Pass function as arguments to other functions
//      -> Return functions from functions
//      -> Call methods on functions.
// - HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS: 
//      -> A function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both
//      -> THis is only possible of FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
//      -> ie: the .addEventLister('click', greet); is a higher order function as it receives in a call back function which is called upon later as soon as the click happens
